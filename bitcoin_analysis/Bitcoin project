Deadline: 12th August, 2018 – 4pm


My Details;
Topic:"The Volatility of Cryptocurrencies: A Critical Analysis of a Financial Bubble Using Bitcoin As A Case Study"

Analysis using Python
I need a line graph showing the yearly closing prices of bitcoin from July 2010 to 2018
-Time series graph from July 2010 to July 2018
– A monte carlos simulation line graph to predict when the bubble will burst for the rest of 2018.
-Also run the monte carlo simulation with this ratio in this link- https://woobull.com/introducing-nvt-ratio-bitcoins-pe-ratio-use-it-to-detect-bubbles/

I am also interested in all the graphs plotted in this article attached on 'Economic bubble and Passage of Time' since it is related to what i am writing.

NVT Ratio:


Hi Dmitry Kalichkin, congratulations for this amazing study! I’m trying to replicate it, but I have some problems. i’ve downloaded the data from this link https://coinmetrics.io/data-downloads/ so i use this formula to calcolate the new NTV: (exchangeVolume(USD)/[txVolume(USD) * (90 AVG txVolume(USD)]. Unfortunatly the result is not the same that…

Go to the profile of Dmitry Kalichkin

Use daily Network Value (aka Market Cap) in numerator, and 90 day avg Tx volume (USD) in denominator. There is no Exchange Volume anywhere in the formula

Can you also do a bitcoin volatility graph with other top cryptocurrencies like ripple litecoin and ethereum

Terms:

Brownian Motion

Laplace Transform

Martingale: In probability theory, a martingale is a sequence of random variables (i.e., a stochastic process) for which, at a particular time in the realized sequence, the expectation of the next value in the sequence is equal to the present observed value even given knowledge of all prior observed values.

Market Value: The term Network Value or Network Valuation is defined by the last traded price multiplied by the total number of tokens in circulation.

Diffusion Proces: In probability theory and statistics, a diffusion process is a solution to a stochastic differential equation. It is a continuous-time Markov process with almost surely continuous sample paths. Brownian motion, reflected Brownian motion and Ornstein–Uhlenbeck processes are examples of diffusion processes.

perturbation: a deviation of a system, moving object, or process from its regular or normal state or path, caused by an outside influence.

Bubble Stages: A bubble cycle is formed by five steps: Displacement, Boom, Euphoria,
Profit Taking, Panic. In the first step the asset price remains at a lower level and the process usually
has an ‘initiative’ to increase. This corresponds to the regime I in our model. During the booming stage,
the price becomes sensitive to positive market news and increases rapidly. Although sometimes due to
divergence in market anticipations that the price may drop down, after oscillations the asset price will
keep increasing. This is described by regime II. In regime III, the peak is shown and large negative
drift is accumulated. This describes the euphoria stage where the asset price hits historically high levels;
however, due to market capital limits or aversions of risk, the market expectations become negative. In
the profit taking stage, asset price becomes sensitive to negative market news and the process shifts from
regime III to regime II. In the end the process drops back to the mean-reversion level, or even continue
to drop to regime I. This describes the last step of the bubble.
