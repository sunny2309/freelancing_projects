In particular, what we're looking for is:

1. Your analysis and understanding of the provided problem, challenge, data and results

2. Quality and creativity of the solution

3. Thought process and ability to convey it to us in words, tables, plots and/or visualizations

4. Readability and usability of the code

-Feel free to bring your personal touch for problem-solving.Thinking outside of the box is a great way to impress.

Submitting solutions are appreciated and recommended.
Ranking high is potentially impressive but not necessarily expected given the time and other constraints.

Expected deliverables are:

A code, preferably in github form

A report describing your problem analysis, approach, results. Reporting model performance is mandatory. (The report can be in pdf, readme markdown, ipynb form, a mix thereof, or whatever you feel is good at conveying information.)
We may have a discussion on the output of the challenge, once it's completed, and discuss what is original output and what is derivative work and the justification for the choice.

IMPORTANT: we know that some people have already shared their solutions to the problem online. We appreciate that you try to avoid copy and paste as much as possible and bring interesting insight into the challenge.
