widger     the yellow wallpaper  by charlotte perkins gilman    it is very seldom that mere ordinary people like john and myself secure ancestral halls for the summer  a colonial mansion a hereditary estate i would say a haunted house and reach the height of romantic felicity but that would be asking too much of fate  still i will proudly declare that there is something queer about it  else why should it be let so cheaply and why have stood so long untenanted  john laughs at me of course but one expects that in marriage  john is practical in the extreme he has no patience with faith an intense horror of superstition and he scoffs openly at any talk of things not to be felt and seen and put down in figures  john is a physician and perhaps i would not say it to a living soul of course but this is dead paper and a great relief to my mind perhaps that is one reason i do not get well faster  you see he does not believe i am sick  and what can one do  if a physician of high standing and ones own husband assures friends and relatives that there is really nothing the matter with one but temporary nervous depression a slight hysterical tendency what is one to do  my brother is also a physician and also of high standing and he says the same thing  so i take phosphates or phosphites whichever it is and tonics and journeys and air and exercise and am absolutely forbidden to work until i am well again  personally i disagree with their ideas  personally i believe that congenial work with excitement and change would do me good  but what is one to do  i did write for a while in spite of them but it does exhaust me a good deal having to be so sly about it or else meet with heavy opposition  i sometimes fancy that in my condition if i had less opposition and more society and stimulus but john says the very worst thing i can do is to think about my condition and i confess it always makes me feel bad  so i will let it alone and talk about the house  the most beautiful place it is quite alone standing well back from the road quite three miles from the village it makes me think of english places that you read about for there are hedges and walls and gates that lock and lots of separate little houses for the gardeners and people  there is a delicious garden i never saw such a garden large and shady full of box bordered paths and lined with long grape covered arbors with seats under them  there were greenhouses too but they are all broken now  there was some legal trouble i believe something about the heirs and co heirs anyhow the place has been empty for years  that spoils my ghostliness i am afraid but i dont care there is something strange about the house i can feel it  i even said so to john one moonlight evening but he said what i felt was a draught and shut the window  i get unreasonably angry with john sometimes im sure i never used to be so sensitive i think it is due to this nervous condition  but john says if i feel so i shall neglect proper self control so i take pains to control myself before him at least and that makes me very tired  i dont like our room a bit i wanted one downstairs that opened on the piazza and had roses all over the window and such pretty old fashioned chintz hangings but john would not hear of it  he said there was only one window and not room for two beds and no near room for him if he took another  he is very careful and loving and hardly lets me stir without special direction  i have a schedule prescription for each hour in the day he takes all care from me and so i feel basely ungrateful not to value it more  he said we came here solely on my account that i was to have perfect rest and all the air i could get your exercise depends on your strength my dear said he and your food somewhat on your appetite but air you can absorb all the time so we took the nursery at the top of the house  it is a big airy room the whole floor nearly with windows that look all ways and air and sunshine galore it was nursery first and then playground and gymnasium i should judge for the windows are barred for little children and there are rings and things in the walls  the paint and paper look as if a boys school had used it it is stripped off the paper in great patches all around the head of my bed about as far as i can reach and in a great place on the other side of the room low down i never saw a worse paper in my life  one of those sprawling flamboyant patterns committing every artistic sin  it is dull enough to confuse the eye in following pronounced enough to constantly irritate and provoke study and when you follow the lame uncertain curves for a little distance they suddenly commit suicide plunge off at outrageous angles destroy themselves in unheard of contradictions  the color is repellant almost revolting a smouldering unclean yellow strangely faded by the slow turning sunlight  it is a dull yet lurid orange in some places a sickly sulphur tint in others  no wonder the children hated it i should hate it myself if i had to live in this room long  there comes john and i must put this away he hates to have me write a word  we have been here two weeks and i havent felt like writing before since that first day  i am sitting by the window now up in this atrocious nursery and there is nothing to hinder my writing as much as i please save lack of strength  john is away all day and even some nights when his cases are serious  i am glad my case is not serious  but these nervous troubles are dreadfully depressing  john does not know how much i really suffer he knows there is no reason to suffer and that satisfies him  of course it is only nervousness it does weigh on me so not to do my duty in any way  i meant to be such a help to john such a real rest and comfort and here i am a comparative burden already  nobody would believe what an effort it is to do what little i am able to dress and entertain and order things  it is fortunate mary is so good with the baby such a dear baby  and yet i cannot be with him it makes me so nervous  i suppose john never was nervous in his life he laughs at me so about this wallpaper  at first he meant to repaper the room but afterwards he said that i was letting it get the better of me and that nothing was worse for a nervous patient than to give way to such fancies  he said that after the wallpaper was changed it would be the heavy bedstead and then the barred windows and then that gate at the head of the stairs and so on  you know the place is doing you good he said and really dear i dont care to renovate the house just for a three months rental  then do let us go downstairs i said there are such pretty rooms there  then he took me in his arms and called me a blessed little goose and said he would go down cellar if i wished and have it whitewashed into the bargain  but he is right enough about the beds and windows and things  it is as airy and comfortable a room as any one need wish and of course i would not be so silly as to make him uncomfortable just for a whim  im really getting quite fond of the big room all but that horrid paper  out of one window i can see the garden those mysterious deep shaded arbors the riotous old fashioned flowers and bushes and gnarly trees  out of another i get a lovely view of the bay and a little private wharf belonging to the estate there is a beautiful shaded lane that runs down there from the house i always fancy i see people walking in these numerous paths and arbors but john has cautioned me not to give way to fancy in the least he says that with my imaginative power and habit of story making a nervous weakness like mine is sure to lead to all manner of excited fancies and that i ought to use my will and good sense to check the tendency so i try  i think sometimes that if i were only well enough to write a little it would relieve the press of ideas and rest me  but i find i get pretty tired when i try  it is so discouraging not to have any advice and companionship about my work when i get really well john says we will ask cousin henry and julia down for a long visit but he says he would as soon put fire works in my pillow case as to let me have those stimulating people about now  i wish i could get well faster  but i must not think about that this paper looks to me as if it knew what a vicious influence it had  there is a recurrent spot where the pattern lolls like a broken neck and two bulbous eyes stare at you upside down  i get positively angry with the impertinence of it and the everlastingness up and down and sideways they crawl and those absurd unblinking eyes are everywhere there is one place where two breadths didnt match and the eyes go all up and down the line one a little higher than the other  i never saw so much expression in an inanimate thing before and we all know how much expression they have i used to lie awake as a child and get more entertainment and terror out of blank walls and plain furniture than most children could find in a toy store  i remember what a kindly wink the knobs of our big old bureau used to have and there was one chair that always seemed like a strong friend  i used to feel that if any of the other things looked too fierce i could always hop into that chair and be safe  the furniture in this room is no worse than inharmonious however for we had to bring it all from downstairs i suppose when this was used as a playroom they had to take the nursery things out and no wonder i never saw such ravages as the children have made here  the wallpaper as i said before is torn off in spots and it sticketh closer than a brother they must have had perseverance as well as hatred  then the floor is scratched and gouged and splintered the plaster itself is dug out here and there and this great heavy bed which is all we found in the room looks as if it had been through the wars  but i dont mind it a bit only the paper  there comes johns sister such a dear girl as she is and so careful of me i must not let her find me writing  she is a perfect and enthusiastic housekeeper and hopes for no better profession i verily believe she thinks it is the writing which made me sick  but i can write when she is out and see her a long way off from these windows  there is one that commands the road a lovely shaded winding road and one that just looks off over the country a lovely country too full of great elms and velvet meadows  this wallpaper has a kind of sub pattern in a different shade a particularly irritating one for you can only see it in certain lights and not clearly then  but in the places where it isnt faded and where the sun is just so i can see a strange provoking formless sort of figure that seems to sulk about behind that silly and conspicuous front design  theres sister on the stairs  well the fourth of july is over the people are gone and i am tired out john thought it might do me good to see a little company so we just had mother and nellie and the children down for a week  of course i didnt do a thing jennie sees to everything now  but it tired me all the same  john says if i dont pick up faster he shall send me to weir mitchell in the fall  but i dont want to go there at all i had a friend who was in his hands once and she says he is just like john and my brother only more so  besides it is such an undertaking to go so far  i dont feel as if it was worth while to turn my hand over for anything and im getting dreadfully fretful and querulous  i cry at nothing and cry most of the time  of course i dont when john is here or anybody else but when i am alone  and i am alone a good deal just now john is kept in town very often by serious cases and jennie is good and lets me alone when i want her to  so i walk a little in the garden or down that lovely lane sit on the porch under the roses and lie down up here a good deal  im getting really fond of the room in spite of the wallpaper perhaps because of the wallpaper  it dwells in my mind so  i lie here on this great immovable bed it is nailed down i believe and follow that pattern about by the hour it is as good as gymnastics i assure you i start well say at the bottom down in the corner over there where it has not been touched and i determine for the thousandth time that i will follow that pointless pattern to some sort of a conclusion  i know a little of the principle of design and i know this thing was not arranged on any laws of radiation or alternation or repetition or symmetry or anything else that i ever heard of  it is repeated of course by the breadths but not otherwise  looked at in one way each breadth stands alone the bloated curves and flourishes a kind of debased romanesque with delirium tremens go waddling up and down in isolated columns of fatuity  but on the other hand they connect diagonally and the sprawling outlines run off in great slanting waves of optic horror like a lot of wallowing seaweeds in full chase  the whole thing goes horizontally too at least it seems so and i exhaust myself in trying to distinguish the order of its going in that direction  they have used a horizontal breadth for a frieze and that adds wonderfully to the confusion  there is one end of the room where it is almost intact and there when the cross lights fade and the low sun shines directly upon it i can almost fancy radiation after all the interminable grotesques seem to form around a common centre and rush off in headlong plunges of equal distraction  it makes me tired to follow it i will take a nap i guess  i dont know why i should write this  i dont want to  i dont feel able  and i know john would think it absurd but i must say what i feel and think in some way it is such a relief  but the effort is getting to be greater than the relief  half the time now i am awfully lazy and lie down ever so much  john says i musnt lose my strength and has me take cod liver oil and lots of tonics and things to say nothing of ale and wine and rare meat  dear john he loves me very dearly and hates to have me sick i tried to have a real earnest reasonable talk with him the other day and tell him how i wish he would let me go and make a visit to cousin henry and julia  but he said i wasnt able to go nor able to stand it after i got there and i did not make out a very good case for myself for i was crying before i had finished  it is getting to be a great effort for me to think straight just this nervous weakness i suppose  and dear john gathered me up in his arms and just carried me upstairs and laid me on the bed and sat by me and read to me till it tired my head  he said i was his darling and his comfort and all he had and that i must take care of myself for his sake and keep well  he says no one but myself can help me out of it that i must use my will and self control and not let any silly fancies run away with me  theres one comfort the baby is well and happy and does not have to occupy this nursery with the horrid wallpaper  if we had not used it that blessed child would have what a fortunate escape why i wouldnt have a child of mine an impressionable little thing live in such a room for worlds  i never thought of it before but it is lucky that john kept me here after all i can stand it so much easier than a baby you see  of course i never mention it to them any more i am too wise but i keep watch of it all the same  there are things in that paper that nobody knows but me or ever will  behind that outside pattern the dim shapes get clearer every day  it is always the same shape only very numerous  and it is like a woman stooping down and creeping about behind that pattern i dont like it a bit i wonder i begin to think i wish john would take me away from here  it is so hard to talk with john about my case because he is so wise and because he loves me so  but i tried it last night  it was moonlight the moon shines in all around just as the sun does  i hate to see it sometimes it creeps so slowly and always comes in by one window or another  john was asleep and i hated to waken him so i kept still and watched the moonlight on that undulating wallpaper till i felt creepy  the faint figure behind seemed to shake the pattern just as if she wanted to get out  i got up softly and went to feel and see if the paper did move and when i came back john was awake  what is it little girl he said dont go walking about like that youll get cold  i though it was a good time to talk so i told him that i really was not gaining here and that i wished he would take me away  why darling said he our lease will be up in three weeks and i cant see how to leave before  the repairs are not done at home and i cannot possibly leave town just now of course if you were in any danger i could and would but you really are better dear whether you can see it or not i am a doctor dear and i know you are gaining flesh and color your appetite is better i feel really much easier about you  i dont weigh a bit more said i nor as much and my appetite may be better in the evening when you are here but it is worse in the morning when you are away  bless her little heart said he with a big hug she shall be as sick as she pleases but now lets improve the shining hours by going to sleep and talk about it in the morning  and you wont go away i asked gloomily  why how can i dear it is only three weeks more and then we will take a nice little trip of a few days while jennie is getting the house ready really dear you are better  better in body perhaps i began and stopped short for he sat up straight and looked at me with such a stern reproachful look that i could not say another word  my darling said he i beg of you for my sake and for our childs sake as well as for your own that you will never for one instant let that idea enter your mind there is nothing so dangerous so fascinating to a temperament like yours it is a false and foolish fancy can you not trust me as a physician when i tell you so  so of course i said no more on that score and we went to sleep before long he thought i was asleep first but i wasnt i lay there for hours trying to decide whether that front pattern and the back pattern really did move together or separately  on a pattern like this by daylight there is a lack of sequence a defiance of law that is a constant irritant to a normal mind  the color is hideous enough and unreliable enough and infuriating enough but the pattern is torturing  you think you have mastered it but just as you get well under way in following it turns a back somersault and there you are it slaps you in the face knocks you down and tramples upon you it is like a bad dream  the outside pattern is a florid arabesque reminding one of a fungus if you can imagine a toadstool in joints an interminable string of toadstools budding and sprouting in endless convolutions why that is something like it  that is sometimes  there is one marked peculiarity about this paper a thing nobody seems to notice but myself and that is that it changes as the light changes  when the sun shoots in through the east window i always watch for that first long straight ray it changes so quickly that i never can quite believe it  that is why i watch it always  by moonlight the moon shines in all night when there is a moon i wouldnt know it was the same paper  at night in any kind of light in twilight candlelight lamplight and worst of all by moonlight it becomes bars the outside pattern i mean and the woman behind it is as plain as can be  i didnt realize for a long time what the thing was that showed behind that dim sub pattern but now i am quite sure it is a woman  by daylight she is subdued quiet i fancy it is the pattern that keeps her so still it is so puzzling it keeps me quiet by the hour  i lie down ever so much now john says it is good for me and to sleep all i can  indeed he started the habit by making me lie down for an hour after each meal  it is a very bad habit i am convinced for you see i dont sleep  and that cultivates deceit for i dont tell them im awake oh no  the fact is i am getting a little afraid of john  he seems very queer sometimes and even jennie has an inexplicable look  it strikes me occasionally just as a scientific hypothesis that perhaps it is the paper  i have watched john when he did not know i was looking and come into the room suddenly on the most innocent excuses and ive caught him several times looking at the paper and jennie too i caught jennie with her hand on it once  she didnt know i was in the room and when i asked her in a quiet a very quiet voice with the most restrained manner possible what she was doing with the paper she turned around as if she had been caught stealing and looked quite angry asked me why i should frighten her so  then she said that the paper stained everything it touched that she had found yellow smooches on all my clothes and johns and she wished we would be more careful  did not that sound innocent but i know she was studying that pattern and i am determined that nobody shall find it out but myself  life is very much more exciting now than it used to be you see i have something more to expect to look forward to to watch i really do eat better and am more quiet than i was  john is so pleased to see me improve he laughed a little the other day and said i seemed to be flourishing in spite of my wallpaper  i turned it off with a laugh i had no intention of telling him it was because of the wallpaper he would make fun of me he might even want to take me away  i dont want to leave now until i have found it out there is a week more and i think that will be enough  im feeling ever so much better i dont sleep much at night for it is so interesting to watch developments but i sleep a good deal in the daytime  in the daytime it is tiresome and perplexing  there are always new shoots on the fungus and new shades of yellow all over it i cannot keep count of them though i have tried conscientiously  it is the strangest yellow that wallpaper it makes me think of all the yellow things i ever saw not beautiful ones like buttercups but old foul bad yellow things  but there is something else about that paper the smell i noticed it the moment we came into the room but with so much air and sun it was not bad now we have had a week of fog and rain and whether the windows are open or not the smell is here  it creeps all over the house  i find it hovering in the dining room skulking in the parlor hiding in the hall lying in wait for me on the stairs  it gets into my hair  even when i go to ride if i turn my head suddenly and surprise it there is that smell  such a peculiar odor too i have spent hours in trying to analyze it to find what it smelled like  it is not bad at first and very gentle but quite the subtlest most enduring odor i ever met  in this damp weather it is awful i wake up in the night and find it hanging over me  it used to disturb me at first i thought seriously of burning the house to reach the smell  but now i am used to it the only thing i can think of that it is like is the color of the paper a yellow smell  there is a very funny mark on this wall low down near the mopboard a streak that runs round the room it goes behind every piece of furniture except the bed a long straight even smooch as if it had been rubbed over and over  i wonder how it was done and who did it and what they did it for round and round and round round and round and round it makes me dizzy  i really have discovered something at last  through watching so much at night when it changes so i have finally found out  the front pattern does move and no wonder the woman behind shakes it  sometimes i think there are a great many women behind and sometimes only one and she crawls around fast and her crawling shakes it all over  then in the very bright spots she keeps still and in the very shady spots she just takes hold of the bars and shakes them hard  and she is all the time trying to climb through but nobody could climb through that pattern it strangles so i think that is why it has so many heads  they get through and then the pattern strangles them off and turns them upside down and makes their eyes white  if those heads were covered or taken off it would not be half so bad  i think that woman gets out in the daytime  and ill tell you why privately ive seen her  i can see her out of every one of my windows  it is the same woman i know for she is always creeping and most women do not creep by daylight  i see her on that long shaded lane creeping up and down i see her in those dark grape arbors creeping all around the garden  i see her on that long road under the trees creeping along and when a carriage comes she hides under the blackberry vines  i dont blame her a bit it must be very humiliating to be caught creeping by daylight  i always lock the door when i creep by daylight i cant do it at night for i know john would suspect something at once  and john is so queer now that i dont want to irritate him i wish he would take another room besides i dont want anybody to get that woman out at night but myself  i often wonder if i could see her out of all the windows at once  but turn as fast as i can i can only see out of one at one time  and though i always see her she may be able to creep faster than i can turn  i have watched her sometimes away off in the open country creeping as fast as a cloud shadow in a high wind  if only that top pattern could be gotten off from the under one i mean to try it little by little  i have found out another funny thing but i shant tell it this time it does not do to trust people too much  there are only two more days to get this paper off and i believe john is beginning to notice i dont like the look in his eyes  and i heard him ask jennie a lot of professional questions about me she had a very good report to give  she said i slept a good deal in the daytime  john knows i dont sleep very well at night for all im so quiet  he asked me all sorts of questions too and pretended to be very loving and kind  as if i couldnt see through him  still i dont wonder he acts so sleeping under this paper for three months  it only interests me but i feel sure john and jennie are secretly affected by it  hurrah this is the last day but it is enough john is to stay in town over night and wont be out until this evening  jennie wanted to sleep with me the sly thing but i told her i should undoubtedly rest better for a night all alone  that was clever for really i wasnt alone a bit as soon as it was moonlight and that poor thing began to crawl and shake the pattern i got up and ran to help her  i pulled and she shook i shook and she pulled and before morning we had peeled off yards of that paper  a strip about as high as my head and half around the room  and then when the sun came and that awful pattern began to laugh at me i declared i would finish it to day  we go away to morrow and they are moving all my furniture down again to leave things as they were before  jennie looked at the wall in amazement but i told her merrily that i did it out of pure spite at the vicious thing  she laughed and said she wouldnt mind doing it herself but i must not get tired  how she betrayed herself that time  but i am here and no person touches this paper but me not alive  she tried to get me out of the room it was too patent but i said it was so quiet and empty and clean now that i believed i would lie down again and sleep all i could and not to wake me even for dinner i would call when i woke  so now she is gone and the servants are gone and the things are gone and there is nothing left but that great bedstead nailed down with the canvas mattress we found on it  we shall sleep downstairs to night and take the boat home to morrow  i quite enjoy the room now it is bare again  how those children did tear about here  this bedstead is fairly gnawed  but i must get to work  i have locked the door and thrown the key down into the front path  i dont want to go out and i dont want to have anybody come in till john comes  i want to astonish him  ive got a rope up here that even jennie did not find if that woman does get out and tries to get away i can tie her  but i forgot i could not reach far without anything to stand on  this bed will not move  i tried to lift and push it until i was lame and then i got so angry i bit off a little piece at one corner but it hurt my teeth  then i peeled off all the paper i could reach standing on the floor it sticks horribly and the pattern just enjoys it all those strangled heads and bulbous eyes and waddling fungus growths just shriek with derision  i am getting angry enough to do something desperate to jump out of the window would be admirable exercise but the bars are too strong even to try  besides i wouldnt do it of course not i know well enough that a step like that is improper and might be misconstrued  i dont like to look out of the windows even there are so many of those creeping women and they creep so fast  i wonder if they all come out of that wallpaper as i did  but i am securely fastened now by my well hidden rope you dont get me out in the road there  i suppose i shall have to get back behind the pattern when it comes night and that is hard  it is so pleasant to be out in this great room and creep around as i please  i dont want to go outside i wont even if jennie asks me to  for outside you have to creep on the ground and everything is green instead of yellow  but here i can creep smoothly on the floor and my shoulder just fits in that long smooch around the wall so i cannot lose my way  why theres john at the door  it is no use young man you cant open it  how he does call and pound  now hes crying for an axe  it would be a shame to break down that beautiful door  john dear said i in the gentlest voice the key is down by the front steps under a plantain leaf  that silenced him for a few moments  then he said very quietly indeed open the door my darling  i cant said i the key is down by the front door under a plantain leaf  and then i said it again several times very gently and slowly and said it so often that he had to go and see and he got it of course and came in he stopped short by the door  what is the matter he cried for gods sake what are you doing  i kept on creeping just the same but i looked at him over my shoulder  ive got out at last said i in spite of you and jane and ive pulled off most of the paper so you cant put me back  now why should that man have fainted but he did and right across my path by the wall so that i had to creep over him every time     end of project gutenbergs the
